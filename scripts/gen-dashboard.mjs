//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// FIVE THINGS TO KNOW BEFORE CHANGING THIS FILE
//
//  1. NO NAMES, EVER, FROM THE ANNOTATION LAYER. This page reports aggregate
//     counts and nothing else: how many annotations, on how many pages, by how
//     many accounts. It never lists an annotator, never ranks them, and never
//     writes an annotation's text. A margin is a place people think out loud
//     in; turning it into a leaderboard changes what they are willing to say
//     there. The Set of userids in collectAnnotations() exists to be measured
//     with .size and must never be iterated into the page.
//
//  2. The output must be a pure function of what the APIs return. The weekly
//     workflow opens a pull request only when the regenerated page differs
//     byte-for-byte from the committed one, so anything that moves on its own
//     — a `new Date()` stamp, an unsorted list — turns a quiet job into a pull
//     request every Sunday for the rest of time. Hence note 3.
//
//  3. THE PAGE'S DATE IS THE NEWEST THING IT COUNTS, AND ONLY THINGS IT
//     COUNTS. This is subtler here than on the derivatives page, because this
//     page reports on the very repository it is committed to, and several
//     obvious timestamps feed back into themselves:
//       * repo.pushed_at moves when THIS JOB pushes chore/dashboard-update.
//       * the newest commit on main becomes this page's own merge commit.
//       * an issue's updated_at moves when someone comments, which changes no
//         number on this page.
//       * an annotation's `updated` moves when its author edits it, which
//         changes no number on this page.
//     Every one of those would date the page forward with nothing to show for
//     it, and produce a pull request every Sunday whose only diff is the date.
//     So the stamp is the maximum over exactly four timestamps, each chosen
//     because it moves if and only if a number on this page moves:
//       * the newest NON-BOT commit (bot commits are excluded from the counts
//         too, exactly as gen-contributors.mjs does, so merging this page's
//         own pull request cannot move the date)
//       * the newest annotation's `created` (not `updated` — see above)
//       * the newest edition fork's `created_at` (a new fork changes the count)
//       * the newest non-bot issue or pull request's `created_at`
//     A number can still change without the date moving — an issue being
//     closed, say. That direction is harmless: the page differs, a pull
//     request opens, and it contains a real change.
//
//  4. Never write a page from a failed or partial fetch. A rate-limited or
//     unauthenticated run that "found no annotations" would publish a
//     confident, plausible-looking zero, and Brandon would read it as the book
//     being ignored rather than as the job being broken. Every API failure
//     throws before anything is written. Two silent-zero traps in particular:
//       * Hypothes.is returns HTTP 200 with {"total": 0, "rows": []} for a bad
//         token rather than 401, so /api/profile is checked first (this is the
//         same pre-flight backup-annotations.mjs does, and for the same
//         reason).
//       * A group the token's account is not a member of also returns 200 and
//         zero rows. That is checked against profile.groups and throws.
//
//  5. Readership is a LINK, not a number. The Plausible Stats API needs a paid
//     plan and a second expiring secret; the site's dashboard is already
//     public, so the page points at it. If textbook.config.json has no
//     `plausible_public_url` key the page says so in as many words rather than
//     quietly dropping the section — an empty spot on a health dashboard is
//     indistinguishable from a healthy one.
//
// The annotation queries mirror scripts/backup-annotations.mjs, which is the
// source of truth for how this API behaves (its header documents the limits
// that were verified against the live API). What is NOT mirrored is that
// script's per-URI fallback: a backup would rather over-collect than miss
// anything, whereas this page would rather fail loudly than publish a number
// it is not sure of.
